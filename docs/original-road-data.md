# Original road data

OUTRUN's courses are raised from the road data in the original's program ROMs. This document owns how those ROMs are
read: the ROM set, its programs, the tables' format and addresses, and the dump the road data tool writes. Which ROMs a
course was raised from, and how the tables become a course document, are added here with the conversion
([NEXT](NEXT.md#stage-rd--outrun-from-the-originals-road-data)).

The ROMs and any raw data taken from them are not committed and appear in no PR: K's zip lies in
`reference-media/outrun/rom/`, the tool's dumps in `reference-media/outrun/rom-data/`. The formats are read by this
project's own code from this description and the ROMs themselves.

## ROM set

MAME's `outrun` (Rev. B). Each CPU's program is two 128 KiB halves, each half interleaved from a ROM of its even bytes
and a ROM of its odd bytes, 64 KiB each:

| CPU  | Addresses       | Even bytes       | Odd bytes        |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| main | 0x00000–0x1FFFF | `epr-10380b.133` | `epr-10382b.118` |
| main | 0x20000–0x3FFFF | `epr-10381b.132` | `epr-10383b.117` |
| sub  | 0x00000–0x1FFFF | `epr-10327a.76`  | `epr-10329a.58`  |
| sub  | 0x20000–0x3FFFF | `epr-10328a.75`  | `epr-10330a.57`  |

Each ROM is checked by its size and its CRC-32 (`OUTRUN_PROGRAM_ROMS`), and each zip entry against the CRC-32 its
archive records; another ROM set is refused. K's set matches:

| ROM              | CRC-32     | ROM             | CRC-32     |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| `epr-10380b.133` | `1f6cadad` | `epr-10327a.76` | `e28a5baf` |
| `epr-10382b.118` | `c4c3fa1a` | `epr-10329a.58` | `da131c81` |
| `epr-10381b.132` | `be8c412b` | `epr-10328a.75` | `d5ec5e5d` |
| `epr-10383b.117` | `10a2014a` | `epr-10330a.57` | `ba9ec82a` |

## Programs

Both CPUs are 68000s: words and longs are big-endian, and an address is an offset in the CPU's assembled program.

Every stage is 1948 positions long: not a table's value but a constant of the main CPU's program, the
`cmpi.w #$079C, ($260006).l` at 0x870A that compares the road position with it, read from there after its instruction
is checked.

Stage numbers (world edition), stage 1 to 5: 1: 0x3C; 2: 0x1E, 0x3B; 3: 0x20, 0x2F, 0x2A; 4: 0x2D, 0x35, 0x33, 0x21;
5: 0x32, 0x23, 0x38, 0x22, 0x26. Which number lies past which fork, and the stages' names, are given only once the
fork's handling or a video shows them.

### Main CPU

- **Stage blocks.** The long at 0xE528 + number × 4 is a stage's block: nine longs, the addresses of its sky's color,
  centre line's, lane lines', edges', surface's and ground's colors, then of its curves, widths and heights, and
  scenery. The centre line, lane lines, edges and surface are four palette words each; the sky and ground one word each
  (0 and 1 in stage 0x3C: whether they number a color table is checked with the colors' conversion).
- **Curves.** {signed word position, word R, word kind}, ending at position −1. Kind 1 is straight, 2 right, 3 left; R
  is a radius in positions. Each entry begins a segment that runs to the next, the last to the stage's end. A stage's
  points lie before its end, but for one height point of stage 0x2A at 2000, which the road position never reaches.
- **Widths and heights.** {word position, word kind, word value, signed word speed}, ending at position 0x7FFF. Kind 0
  is a height point, its value a height table's number; any other kind is a width point, its value the target road
  width, which the road width approaches by `speed × 16 / 303` units a position from 0x1C2 (450).
- **Scenery.** {word position, u8 count, u8 type}, ending at position 0x7FFF.
- **Scenery types.** The long at 0x1A43C + type × 4 is a type: {word frequency, word last entry's offset}, then 8-byte
  entries up to that offset, {u8 flags, s8 x, signed word y, u8 unknown, u8 sprite, u8 unknown, u8 palette}. Flags bit 0
  mirrors, bit 1 casts a shadow, bits 4–7 choose the drawing; x is in 16 road-width units, y in 128.
- **Fork stretch.** Three longs at 0x1DFA4: its curves', widths and heights', and scenery's addresses.
- **Goal stretches.** Five longs at 0xE514, each a block of three longs: a goal stretch's curves', widths and heights',
  and scenery's addresses. Each goal has three curve segments, the last from 312.

### Sub CPU

- **Road paths.** The long at 0x1224 + number × 4 is a stage's path: 0x904 positions of {signed word x, signed word y},
  a heading vector of length 4096 at each position, the stage's 1948 and 360 looking ahead into the fork. Vectors at
  segment joins differ in length, so only their directions are used. The fork stretch's path is at 0x3A33E, 600
  positions (its 384 and its look-ahead); the goal stretches' at 0x3ACA0, 624 positions shared by all five; past them
  the vectors are no longer 4096 long.
- **Paths against curves.** Over each curve the path turns by 1/R a position, left where kind 3 says, right where 2
  says (the measured radius within 2.3 % of R in every stage). Every stage's path turns 0° or ±360° over its 1948
  positions and lines up with its curves (`pathOffset`), but for stage 0x38's, which runs 48 positions ahead of them
  (0x2A's by 1).
- **Height tables.** The long at 0x220A + number × 4 is a height table: {u8 kind, u8 step}, then by kind:
  - 0: u8 descent factor, u8 ascent factor;
  - 1 and 2: word wait;
  - 3: a word;
  - 4: word horizon, and no entries.

  The entries, signed words, follow from the table's fifth byte and end at −1. A table of another kind is refused.

### Palette words

A palette word `w` is RGB555, each channel four bits over a low bit shared from bits 12–14:
R = (w & 0xF) << 1 | (w >> 12 & 1), G = (w >> 4 & 0xF) << 1 | (w >> 13 & 1), B = (w >> 8 & 0xF) << 1 | (w >> 14 & 1).
Strips take it as their RGB555 as it is.

## Hills

The original builds its hills as shapes on its screen. Its road is 512 lines; level, each line's slope is the horizon's
base 0x240 × 16 (16.16 rows), so the road's top is row 223 − 512 × 9216 / 65536 = 151 (`k1`'s 151.4). The road's top
along a stage (`hillsAlong`) follows from its height points and tables alone; nothing is fitted:

- **The shape.** The lines form seven segments, near to far: s0 = 255(1 − f), s1 = (256 + 255f)/2, and the rest
  R = 512 − s0 − s1 halved in turn, R/2, R/4, R/8, R/16, R/16. Segment 0's slope is the base; each further segment's is
  its predecessor's plus an increment. Each line's row is 223 − the slopes summed from the nearest line ÷ 65536; the
  road's top is the least row.
- **Points.** A height point starts its table when the road position reaches it; one reached while a table runs is
  dropped.
- **Kind 0** slides its entries through the segments: at entry `i`, a share `f` of it passed, segment 1's increment is
  16·e[i]·(1 − f) and segment k's (k ≥ 2) 16·e[i + k − 1]. An entry spans 2.125 × step × m positions, m the ascent
  factor where e > 0, the descent factor where e < 0, 1 where e = 0. The table ends when e[i + 6] is its end mark.
- **Kinds 1 and 2** rise over 2.125 × step positions, hold, and return over 2.125 × step: their two entries are segments
  1's and 2's increments (×16) at the rise's share. The hold counts the wait down by the whole part of
  `120 × positions advanced ÷ step` each tick, so it lasts longer the slower the car (`holdLength`).
- **Kind 3** slides its entries in as kind 0 does (each over 2.125 × step), holds the full window by its word as kinds 1
  and 2 hold, and returns it at a falling share over 2.125 × step.
- **Kind 4** moves the horizon's base to its word over 2.125 × step positions, and it stays.

Kinds 0 and 1 are checked on `k1` (COCONUT BEACH, no fit; `k1`'s position is the displayed speed's integral, which lags
the original's later in the stage):

| Table (kind) | Rule's road top      | `k1`'s     |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| 211 (0)      | row 112.5 at 40.5    | 107 to 113 |
| 134 (0)      | row 122.2 at 462     | 121        |
| 213 (0)      | rows 101.4 and 109.4 | 100, 107   |
| 32 (1)       | hold at row 169.1    | 166 to 173 |

Kinds 3 and 4 follow the same idea and are not yet checked against footage; under kind 4's raised base some of
stage 0x3B's tables put the road's top at or above the screen's top.

## Dump

`npm run road-data -- read` ([Development](development.md#road-data-commands)) checks and reads the ROM zip and writes
`superoutride.outrun-road-data` version 1, `outrun.json` in the dump directory: the ROMs' names and CRCs; every stage
(number, block, colors as words and RGB555, curves, widths and heights, scenery, road path); the fork stretch and the
goal stretches with their paths; the height tables and scenery types their points name. It refuses a stage whose path
does not turn 0° or ±360° over its length, and prints each stage's counts, points past its end, its path's offset
against its curves, and each curve's radius against the one its aligned path measures, positions over its heading
change two positions in from either end (a join spreads its turn over a position or two). `npm run road-data -- hills`
writes each stage's road top by the [hills](#hills) at every quarter position, `hills-<stage>.json` beside the dump,
the holds counted at `--kmh` (293 unless told), and prints each height point's highest and lowest top.
